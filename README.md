Use keystrokes to benefit you

Current idea: A generalized library for distibuted computing in the front-end

- [ ] Find people doing this already. How are they doing it?
- [ ] Call a function on the back-end that triggers functions to run on the front-end for clients connected with websockets
- [ ] Start with a server and a client-side script
- [ ] Call a function on the back-end
- [ ] A chrome extension makes sense

Ideas:

- UI builder that auto-generates a UI
- An API that generates images from CSS
- An API that generates fractal patterns for backgrounds
- A dial widget
- A CRUD generator with API routes and models

Old ideas:

~~0) Gather data for ads~~
~~**Goal 1:**~~
~~A react component that records what you type and then sends a request to an ad server
that then serves relevant ads based on what you are typing.~~

~~**Goal 2:**
Persist the user so that he gets more relevant ads. Maybe with session and key?
What are relevant ads? They are ads that revolve around what the user is talking about most recently? You also need ads with meta-data companies etc...~~~~~

~~**Goal 3:**~~
~~Persist the user across multiple websites~~

~~1) A keylogger that records what you type and notices patterns. Example you are a programmer and want to know what
you type alot so that you can avoid writing lots of boilerplate.~~

~~2) Create macros for instructional purposes.~~
