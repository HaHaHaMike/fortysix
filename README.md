Use keystrokes to benefit you

Current idea:

**Goal 1:**
A react component that records what you type and then sends a request to an ad server
that then serves relevant ads based on what you are typing.

**Goal 2:**
Persist the user so that he gets more relevant ads. Maybe with session and key?

Old ideas:

~~1) A keylogger that records what you type and notices patterns. Example you are a programmer and want to know what
you type alot so that you can avoid writing lots of boilerplate.~~

~~2) Create macros for instructional purposes.~~
