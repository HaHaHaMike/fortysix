# fsa-stackathon

**Current idea:**

SaaS for distibuted computing that empowers researchers and app developers to use p2p networks for offloading computationally expensive processes. Provides an interface to customers to add jobs and a web/desktop client for volunteers/paid people to choose what jobs or organizations they want to contribute their latent processing power to. 

**Back-up Ideas:**

- UI builder that auto-generates a UI
- An API that generates images from CSS
- An API that generates fractal patterns for backgrounds
- A dial widget
- A CRUD generator with API routes and models
