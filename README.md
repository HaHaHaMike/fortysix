Use keystrokes to benefit you

Current idea: SaaS for distibuted computing that enpowers researchers and app developers to use p2p networks for offloading computationally expensive processes. Provides an interface to customers to add jobs and a web/desktop client for volunteers/paid people to choose what jobs they want to contribute their latent processing power to.

- [ ] consider if mvp could just use node instead of web for remote processes
- [ ] Call a function on the back-end that triggers functions to run on the front-end for clients connected with websockets
- [ ] Start with a server and a client-side script

- [ ] A chrome extension makes sense
- [ ] for demo benchmark gops to compare to ec2 pricing

Back-up Ideas:

- UI builder that auto-generates a UI
- An API that generates images from CSS
- An API that generates fractal patterns for backgrounds
- A dial widget
- A CRUD generator with API routes and models

Old ideas:

~~0) Gather data for ads~~
~~**Goal 1:**~~
~~A react component that records what you type and then sends a request to an ad server
that then serves relevant ads based on what you are typing.~~

~~**Goal 2:**
Persist the user so that he gets more relevant ads. Maybe with session and key?
What are relevant ads? They are ads that revolve around what the user is talking about most recently? You also need ads with meta-data companies etc...~~~~~

~~**Goal 3:**~~
~~Persist the user across multiple websites~~

~~1) A keylogger that records what you type and notices patterns. Example you are a programmer and want to know what
you type alot so that you can avoid writing lots of boilerplate.~~

~~2) Create macros for instructional purposes.~~
